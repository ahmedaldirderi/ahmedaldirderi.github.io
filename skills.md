## Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning

For my Computer Science Capstone Project my classmate and friend Yuki Kawahara we created a predator prey simulation through reinforcement learning.

We taught a predator to hunt a prey, a tom and jerry if you will, by letting it know when it makes a good move and a bad one. It then calculates the best decision to make based on its previous memory. The graph below whos how it performs after 10,000 iterations -- each iteration ends after the predator catches the prey or it runs out of moves.
